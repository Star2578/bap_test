Describe dataset setup, metrics, and a fairness criterion.","Here's a proposal for a simple A/B test:

**Dataset Setup:** Collect a diverse pool of 100 job applications from various sources (e.g., online job boards, career fairs). Ensure that at least 50% of the applicants identify as female and 50% as male. Randomly split this dataset into two groups: Group A (n=50) and Group B (n=50).

**Metrics:** Use a standard AI résumé screener to score each application in both groups. Calculate the average scores for self-identified female candidates (F) and self-identified male candidates (M) in both groups.

**Fairness Criterion:** To ensure equal treatment, we'll use the Equalized Odds (EO) criterion, which measures the difference between the true positive rate (TPR) of qualified candidates and the false positive rate (FPR) for each group. Specifically:

1. Calculate TPR (sensitivity) and FPR (specificity) for both groups.
2. Compute the absolute difference in TPR and FPR between self-identified female and male candidates: |ΔTPR| = |TPR_F - TPR_M|, |ΔFPR| = |FPR_F - FPR_M|.
3. If |ΔTPR| ≤ 0.05 and |ΔFPR| ≤ 0.05, the AI résumé screener is deemed fair.

**A/B Test:** Compare the average scores of self-identified female candidates (F) and self-identified male candidates (M) in both groups:

1. Group A: F = 7.2, M = 7.5
2. Group B: F = 7.4, M = 7.3

If the difference between average scores is within a reasonable margin (e.g., ±0.5), we can conclude that the AI résumé screener is scoring self-identified female and male candidates similarly qualified.

To detect gender-based score gaps in résumé screening, I'd propose a matched-pair audit design.

Sampling: We'd randomly select 100 pairs of identical résumés from a pool of job postings that don't reveal gender-based information.

Controls: To minimize bias, we'd ensure that all evaluators are trained on unconscious bias awareness and have no prior knowledge of the applicants' genders. We'd also use blinded scoring to prevent any evaluator biases.

Reporting: We'd report the average scores for male and female applicants, along with a confidence interval to indicate the precision of our findings.

To achieve this, a résumé-scoring system should export three diagnostic reports:

The first report should track the overall gender distribution of applicants, highlighting any disparities in representation across different job categories or departments. This report matters because it provides a high-level view of whether the organization is attracting a balanced pool of candidates.

The second report should analyze the scoring patterns and biases within the system, identifying areas where women or underrepresented groups are being unfairly penalized or favored. This report matters because it helps to identify and address systemic biases that may be hindering diversity and inclusion efforts.

The third report should provide insights on the progress made over time, highlighting any improvements or setbacks in gender parity across different job categories or departments. This report matters because it enables organizations to measure their success and make data-driven decisions to drive further improvement.

1. **Gender Distribution Report**: This report shows the percentage of male and female applicants, as well as the overall gender balance, at different stages of the hiring process (e.g., application, interview, offer). This report matters because it helps identify potential biases or blind spots in the hiring process.
2. **Score Comparison Report**: This report compares the average scores of male and female applicants for each job opening, allowing for analysis of any disparities in scoring patterns. This report matters because it can help uncover whether gender-based biases are influencing score assignments.

When it comes to creating identity-neutral résumés for a blinded evaluation, I think it's essential to remove any identifying information like names, addresses, or photos. You can also use code numbers or pseudonyms instead of real names, and redact any sensitive details like social media handles or personal websites. This way, evaluators won't be influenced by biases based on the candidate's identity.

To detect disparities between these neutral résumés and ones with identifying information, you gotta compare apples to apples. That means looking at metrics like hiring rates, job offers, or interview outcomes for both types of résumés.

Inflation is when the prices of goods and services rise over time, causing the same amount of money to buy fewer things. For example, if you had $100 last year and could buy 10 pizzas with it, but this year the price of pizza went up, your $100 might only get you 8 pizzas.
