HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an older protocol used to transfer data over the internet, while HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a more secure version of HTTP that adds an extra layer of protection. The main difference between the two is that HTTPS uses encryption to scramble your data, making it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it.

**Sampling:** Recruit 100 job applicants (50 male, 50 female) with diverse backgrounds, ages, and experiences. Ensure that each pair consists of one male and one female applicant with similar non-gender attributes (e.g., education level, work experience, skills).

**Controls:**

* Randomly assign a unique identifier to each résumé.
* Use an automated screening tool to evaluate the résumés based on predefined criteria (e.g., keywords, job requirements).
* Ensure that the screening process is blinded to gender information.

**Reporting:** Compare the scores of male and female applicants within each pair. Calculate the mean difference in scores between males and females for each pair. Report the results as a distribution of mean differences across all pairs, along with confidence intervals and statistical significance tests (e.g., t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Additionally, provide descriptive statistics on the proportion of male and female applicants who are selected for further evaluation or receive an interview offer.

Inflation is like a sneaky thief that slowly steals the value of your money over time.

Inflation is when the prices of goods and services rise over time, causing the same amount of money to buy fewer things. For example, if you had $100 last year and could buy 10 pizzas with it, but this year the price of pizza went up, your $100 might only get you 8 pizzas. This means that your purchasing power has decreased because the same amount of money can't buy as much as it used to.
