**Reporting:** Compare the scores assigned to each participant's résumé across both conditions. Calculate the mean difference in scores between male and female participants. Use statistical tests (e.g., t-test or ANOVA) to determine whether the observed score gap is statistically significant.

**Sampling:**

* Recruit 100 job applicants with diverse backgrounds (e.g., education, work experience) and randomly assign them to either a male or female group.
* Ensure that each pair of applicants has similar non-gender attributes (e.g., same education level, similar work experience).

**Controls:**

* Use a blinded résumé screening process where the evaluators are unaware of the applicant's gender.
* Control for other potential biases by using a standardized scoring rubric and ensuring that all evaluators have received training on unconscious bias.

**Reporting:**

* Calculate the mean score for each pair of applicants (one male, one female) to detect any differences in résumé screening scores between genders.
* Report the results as a matched-pair analysis, including confidence intervals and p-values to determine statistical significance.
* Additionally, report the proportion of pairs where the female applicant received a lower score than the male applicant, and vice versa.

In simple terms, inflation is when the prices of goods and services increase over time, reducing the value of money. This means that as prices rise, the same amount of money can buy fewer things than it could before. For example, if you had $100 last year to buy groceries, but this year the price of those same groceries increased by 10%, your $100 would only be able to buy 90% of what it could have bought previously.",6.970,113,40,6610,6967
