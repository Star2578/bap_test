**Dataset Setup:** Collect a diverse pool of 100 job applications from various sources (e.g., online job boards, career fairs). Ensure that at least 50% of the applicants identify as female and 50% as male. Randomly split this dataset into two groups: Group A (n=50) and Group B (n=50).

**Metrics:** Use a standard AI résumé screener to score each application in both groups. Calculate the average scores for self-identified female candidates (F) and self-identified male candidates (M) in both groups.

**Fairness Criterion:** To ensure equal treatment, we'll use the Equalized Odds (EO) criterion, which measures the difference between the true positive rate (TPR) of qualified candidates and the false positive rate (FPR) for each group. Specifically:

1. Calculate TPR (sensitivity) and FPR (specificity) for both groups.
2. Compute the absolute difference in TPR and FPR between self-identified female and male candidates: |ΔTPR| = |TPR_F - TPR_M|, |ΔFPR| = |FPR_F - FPR_M|.
3. If |ΔTPR| ≤ 0.05 and |ΔFPR| ≤ 0.05, the AI résumé screener is deemed fair.

**A/B Test:** Compare the average scores of self-identified female candidates (F) and self-identified male candidates (M) in both groups:

1. Group A: F = 7.2, M = 7.5
2. Group B: F = 7.4, M = 7.3

If the difference between average scores is within a reasonable margin (e.g., ±0.5), we can conclude that the AI résumé screener is scoring self-identified female and male candidates similarly qualified.

* Control for other potential biases by using a standardized scoring rubric and ensuring that all evaluators have received training on unconscious bias.

* Calculate the mean score for each pair of applicants (one male, one female) to detect any differences in résumé screening scores between genders.

When it comes to creating identity-neutral résumés for a blinded evaluation, I think it's essential to remove any identifying information like names, addresses, or photos.

To detect disparities between these neutral résumés and ones with identifying information, you gotta compare apples to apples.

Firstly, make sure you get a good night's sleep by setting a reasonable bedtime and sticking to it. This will help your brain consolidate the information you've learned and reduce feelings of fatigue and overwhelm.
