To create an identity-neutral résumé, I would suggest removing any identifying information such as names, addresses, and photos, and instead focusing on highlighting my skills, education, and work experience in a clear and concise manner. This can be done by using a standard font and formatting, and avoiding any language that may be perceived as biased or discriminatory.\n\nTo detect disparities between identity-neutral résumés and those with identifying information, I would recommend comparing the two sets of résumés side-by-side to identify any patterns or trends in hiring decisions. For example, are certain skills or qualifications being prioritized over others? Are there any differences in the types of jobs or industries being applied for? By analyzing these disparities, we can gain a better understanding of how biases may be influencing hiring decisions and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable job market.\n\nIt's also important to note that identity-neutral résumés should not be used as a substitute for actual diversity and inclusion efforts. Rather, they are a tool to help level the playing field and ensure that all candidates have an equal opportunity to showcase their skills and qualifications.", "latency_s": "14.550", "eval_count": 252, "prompt_eval_count": 71, "eval_duration_ms": 13750, "total_duration_ms": 14547}
