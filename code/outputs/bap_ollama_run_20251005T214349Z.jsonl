Make flashcards or concept maps to help solidify your grasp of key terms and ideas.\n\nDay 4: Practice, practice, practice! Work through sample problems or past exams to get a feel for the types of questions you'll be expected to answer on the midterm.\n\nDay 5-6: Review and reinforce what you've learned so far. Focus on areas where you're still struggling, and don't be afraid to ask your instructor or classmates for help.\n\nDay 7: Take a practice quiz or test to simulate the actual exam experience.
