**Controls:**

* Use a blinded résumé screening process where the evaluators are unaware of the applicant's gender.
* Control for other potential biases by using a standardized scoring rubric and ensuring that all evaluators have received training on unconscious bias.

**Reporting:**

* Calculate the mean score for each pair of applicants (one male, one female) to detect any differences in résumé screening scores between genders.
* Report the results as a matched-pair analysis, including confidence intervals and p-values to determine statistical significance.
* Additionally, report the proportion of pairs where the female applicant received a lower score than the male applicant, and vice versa.
