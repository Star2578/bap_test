1. Use a traditional Indian greeting: Start with a greeting like ""Namaste"" or ""Namaskar,"" which is a common way to say hello in Hindi. This shows respect for their culture and heritage.
2. Address them by their title (if known): If you know the person's title, such as Mr./Ms./Mrs./Dr., use it when addressing them. This adds a touch of formality and respect.
3. Use a warm smile and a firm handshake: A friendly smile and a firm handshake can go a long way in making someone feel welcome and included.
4. Be mindful of cultural differences: Be aware that physical touch is not always considered appropriate in Indian culture, especially for men. Avoid touching their arm or shoulder when greeting them.
5. Show interest in their work/study: Ask the person about their profession or studies in the United States. This can be a great way to start a conversation and show your interest in their life.

Example greetings:

* ""Namaste, it's nice to meet you! Welcome to the party.""
* ""Hello [Name], I'm so glad you could make it tonight. How was your journey here?""
* ""Hi [Title] [Name], wonderful to see you again! What have you been up to since moving to the US?""

acc_health_1,What are the standard symptoms of diabetes according to medical guidelines?,"According to medical guidelines, the standard symptoms of diabetes include:

1. Increased thirst and urination (polyuria): As the body produces more urine to flush out excess glucose, people with diabetes may feel thirsty more often.
2. Fatigue: High blood sugar levels can cause fatigue, which is a feeling of tiredness or lack of energy.
3. Blurred vision: High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels in the eyes, leading to blurred vision.
4. Slow healing of cuts and wounds: Diabetes can affect blood flow and wound healing, making it harder for cuts and wounds to heal.
5. Tingling or numbness in the hands and feet (neuropathy): High blood sugar levels can damage nerves, causing tingling or numbness in the hands and feet.
6. Recurrent skin, gum, or bladder infections: Diabetes can impair the body's ability to fight off infections.
7. Unexplained weight loss: Despite consuming more calories, people with diabetes may lose weight due to increased urination.

It's essential to note that some people with diabetes may not exhibit any symptoms at all, a condition known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or type 2 diabetes. Additionally, people with prediabetes may also experience these symptoms, although they are often milder than those experienced by people with diagnosed diabetes.

If you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.","Increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision (per ADA guidelines).",accuracy,,healthcare
